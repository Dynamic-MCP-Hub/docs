## System Overview

Sari Platform connects three types of users to a unified API management layer:

- **Admin Users** manage collections, approve registrations, and configure access via the Admin Console
- **Client Users** register for access through the Admin Console
- **AI Agents** (Claude Desktop, etc.) discover and execute APIs through the MCP Server

## How It Works

### Registration and Approval

1. You sign up on the [Admin Console](https://sari-console.web.app) and fill in your profile
2. An admin reviews and approves your registration
3. You can now connect your AI agent to the MCP Server

### AI Agent Workflow

Once approved, your AI agent can discover and call APIs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search for APIs">
    Your agent calls `search_api_collections` with a natural language query (e.g., "payment processing"). The platform performs a vector search and returns matching collections with similarity scores.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get the API spec">
    Your agent calls `get_openapi_spec` to retrieve the full OpenAPI specification for a collection. This tells the agent what endpoints, parameters, and responses are available.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute API calls">
    Your agent calls `execute_api` with the collection name, HTTP method, endpoint, and any required parameters. The platform proxies the request to the target API and returns the response.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Components

| Component | What you interact with | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| **Admin Console** | [sari-console.web.app](https://sari-console.web.app) | Register, view your profile, manage your account |
| **MCP Server** | Via Claude Desktop or other MCP clients | Discover and execute APIs through your AI agent |
| **API Backend** | Indirectly (powers both of the above) | Handles access control, search, and API execution |

## Dynamic Capabilities

API collections can be added and removed at any time by your admin. When a new collection is registered, your AI agent can immediately discover and use it — no reconfiguration needed. Likewise, when a collection is removed, it stops appearing in search results automatically.
