  <Step title="Connect to the MCP Server">
    Add Sari to your Claude Desktop configuration.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="macOS">
        Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "sari-platform": {
              "command": "npx",
              "args": [
                "-y",
                "mcp-remote",
                "https://mcp-server.sari-platform.com/sse"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Windows">
        Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`:

        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "sari-platform": {
              "command": "npx",
              "args": [
                "-y",
                "mcp-remote",
                "https://mcp-server.sari-platform.com/sse"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Restart Claude Desktop after saving the config file.

    For detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting, see the [MCP Setup guide](/mcp/setup).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start using Sari">
    Open a new conversation in Claude Desktop. You should see **sari-platform** in the MCP tools list.

    Try a test query:

    ```
    Search for payment processing APIs
    ```

    Claude will call the `search_api_collections` tool and return matching APIs.
